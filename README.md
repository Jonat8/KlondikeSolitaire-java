Klondike Solitaire is a game played with one deck of playing cards (minus the Jokers) and the cards are dealt in such a way that there are 7 stacks of cards with the first stack having one card and each stack having one more than the one on its left. The top card in each stack will be flipped to face up. Once all stacks have been dealt, the remaining cards will go in a separate pile, “Excess Pile” (to explain rules) that will be used to progress the game if there are no available moves. Cards in this area will be called “The Playing Area” (to explain rules) There are also 4 empty stacks that are reserved for the suits (one for each suit). These will be called “Reserved Stacks” (to explain rules)
OBJECTIVE
The objective of the game is to get all of the cards into their respective suit’s Reserved Stack
HOW TO PLAY
The player can make a move in the Playing Area by moving cards to stack cards in descending order (King, Queen, Jack, 10, …, 2, Ace) in alternating colors (suits do not matter)
If one of the 7 stacks in the playing area is empty, only Kings can be moved there
If no moves are available, the player can reveal cards (one at a time on easy mode, and three at once on hard mode) from the Excess Pile and play those cards into the playing area if possible
The player can move cards into the Reserved Stacks by moving cards (Starting with the ace) into their respective suits in increasing order
Cards in the Reserved Stacks may be moved into the Playing Area if possible/necessary
